## `Date Input` — With label

<Canvas of={DateInputStories.DateInputStory} />

<Controls of={DateInputStories.DateInputStory} />

## `Required Date Input` — With required status

<Canvas of={DateInputStories.DateInputRequiredStory} />

<Controls of={DateInputStories.DateInputRequiredStory} />

## `Date` Without label

The component without the label is a bare-bones version of the component. It is useful when you need to customize the layout of the component.

<Canvas of={DateStories.DateStory} />

<Controls of={DateStories.DateStory} />

## Required

The component can be required. In that case, the label will be followed by a red asterisk. In order to make the component required, set the `required` prop to `true`.

Alternatively you can to add to the `classModifier` the value `required`. This behaviour exists to keep backward compatibility but might disapear in the future.
