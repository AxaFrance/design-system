# Radio components

## RadioItem

This is the smallest component for the radio. It only contains the input with a label.

<Canvas of={RadioItemStories.RadioItemStory} />
<Controls of={RadioItemStories.RadioItemStory} />

## Radio

This is the a multi-options component. You can use it to create a list of options without the main label.

<Canvas of={RadioStories.RadioStory} />
<Controls of={RadioStories.RadioStory} />

## RadioInput

This is the complete input component. It contains the main label and the list of options.

<Canvas of={RadioInput.RadioInputStory} />
<Controls of={RadioInput.RadioInputStory} />

## Modes

The Radio component has 3 modes: `default`, `classic` and `inline`.
You can see them in action in the stories above.

## Required

The component can be required. In that case, the label will be followed by a red asterisk. In order to make the component required, set the `required` prop to `true`.

Alternatively you can to add to the `classModifier` the value `required`. This behaviour exists to keep backward compatibility but might disapear in the future.
