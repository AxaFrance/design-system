# Release Notes for Slash 1.2.0

## Added

### Link Component

Added a new `Link` component to the Slash design system, providing a consistent
way to create hyperlinks across the application. It can be used as classic `a`
or with any custom component, such as a `button` or a `Link` from
`react-router-dom`.

Example usage:

```jsx
<Link
    href="https://axafrance.github.io/design-system/slash/react/latest/"
    target="_blank"
    rightIcon={<Svg src={openInNew} />}
>
    This is an anchor tag going to the Slash storybook
</Link>
<br />
<Link
  render={(props) => (
    <RouterLink to="/contact" {...props}>
      Contact page
    </RouterLink>
  )}
/>
```

### CSS Tokens

The design-system's colors are now available as CSS tokens. This allows for
easier customization and theming of the design system components. This is one of
the first step in our goal to get rid of SASS, to avoid forcing our users to use
SASS in their projects.

You can find the exhaustive list of tokens in the
[source code](https://github.com/AxaFrance/design-system/blob/main/slash/css/src/common/tokens.css).

```css
.my-custom-class {
  background-color: var(--axablue10);
}
```

### NestedQuestion Component

Added a new `NestedQuestion` component to the design system. This component is
used to display a nested input that is conditionnally displayed depending on the
value of another input.

It is just a wrapper and only has a `children` prop:

```jsx
<NestedQuestion>
  <p>Whatever you want here</p>
</NestedQuestion>
```

## Improvements

### NavBar

Allows passing NavBar props through MenuTitleWrapper to enable customization of
properties such as `positionInit`. Additionally, updates the position index upon
clicking a NavLink, ensuring that the correct nav item is selected without
requiring a page reload (example : when navigating between pages using React
Router).

### Title can now have content on the left and right

The `Title` component now supports adding content on the left and right sides of
the horizontal line. This is useful for adding buttons, links or other elements
next to the title.

```jsx
<Title
  classModifier="af-title"
  className=""
  contentLeft={<Button>Left button</Button>}
  contentRight={<Link href="/">Click me</Link>}
>
  Title with content
</Title>
```

### FileInput `onChange` event now has a fileAction property

The `onChange` event of the `FileInput` component now includes a `fileAction`
property which is either `"add"` or `"delete"`. You can now use this property to
determine if the user added or deleted a file.

```jsx
<FileInput
  id="fileInput"
  name="fileInput"
  label="FileInput"
  onChange={({ fileAction }) => {
    if (fileAction === "add") {
      console.log("File added");
    } else if (fileAction === "delete") {
      console.log("File deleted");
    }
  }}
/>
```

### Select now supports optgroups

The `Select` component now supports `optgroup` elements, allowing you to group
options together. You can pass whatever you want as `children`.

Using children will override the `options` prop, and it is now the recommanded
way to pass options to the `Select` component. `options` are now marked as
deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

This is unfortunately not available yet in the `SelectInput` because the
`children` prop was already used, to add content on the right of the input. This
may come in a future release as a breaking change.

```jsx
<Select onChange={onChange} {...args}>
  <optgroup label="Groupe 1">
    <option>Option 1</option>
    <option>Option 2</option>
  </optgroup>
  <optgroup label="Groupe 2">
    <option>Option 3</option>
    <option>Option 4</option>
  </optgroup>
</Select>
```

### Multiple choice on same page

When using multiple `Choice` components on the same page, we used to have an issue, even by selecting an option on any of the `Choice` components, only the first `Choice` component would be selected. This is now fixed, and you can use multiple `Choice` components on the same page without any issue.

### Accessibility

#### Add labelledby attribute to definitions in Infos component

Add a labelledby attribute to definitions in `Infos` components. This improves
testing as well, as you can now target the definitions by name:

```jsx
// In your component
<Infos
  infos={[
    {
      word: "Name",
      definition: "John Doe",
    },
  ]}
/>;

// In your test
const definition = screen.getByRole("definition", {
  name: /name/i,
}).innerText; // === "John Doe"

// Generated HTML
<dl class="af-contrat__list">
  <dt id="info-id-3" class="af-contrat__word">
    Name
  </dt>
  <dd class="af-contrat__def" aria-labelledby="info-id-3">
    John Doe
  </dd>
</dl>;
```

#### Inputs errors are linked to the input

An input in error state now has an `aria-describedby` attribute that links the
error message to the input. This improves accessibility. In addition, errored
inputs are marked invalid with the `aria-invalid` attribute.

#### Miscellaneous

- Red colors for checkbox in error state are now darker for better contrast
- `User` component inside the `Header` now have the correct color as blue axa.
  Also the user is not underlined if it is not a link.
- Aria-label for the close button in the Alert component is now customizable via
  `ariaLabel` property.

```jsx
<Alert title="my alert" ariaLabel="Close this alert" classModifier="error">
  <ul>
    <li>The last name is required</li>
    <li>The first name is required</li>
    <li>Email is required</li>
    <li>The date format is invalid</li>
  </ul>
</Alert>
```

- You can now pass `selectAriaLabel` to the `Paging` component to customize the
  aria-label of the select element used to chose how many element to display per
  page.
- The `Modal`s are now correctly labelled with the `aria-label` attribute
  instead of `aria-describedby`.
- `Select` component now has a blue outline on focus, making it easier to see
  which element is focused.
- `Restitution` component now uses `h3` tags for the title (inside the
  restitution header) instead of a `div`. For the title inside the restitution
  it is now an `h4` tag instead of a `div`. This improves accessibility and
  semantic structure of the HTML.
- Glyphicon inside `Action` component has now an `img` role.
- Glyphicon inside `Alert` component has now a `presentation` role making it not
  readable for screen readers.

### Miscellaneous

- Added an alias to import the axa-logo easily

```ts
import logo from "@axa-fr/design-system-slash-css/logo-axa.svg";
```

**The previous alias `@axa-fr/design-system-slash-css/dist/common/logo-axa.svg`
is still available but is deprecated will be removed in a future release.**

- Icons in the `HeaderTitle` are now a bit smaller and padded to the right side
- `HeaderTitle` has now the correct padding and font caracteristics.
- `DateInput` now correctly forwards the `ref` to the input element
- `Summary` doesn't log warning in the console anymore
- `Pagination` component use the `Select` component instead of an html
  `<select>`.

## Deprecations

Here are the deprecations in this release:

- The `options` prop of the `Select` component is now deprecated. Use the
  `children` prop instead to pass options.
- `SelectBase` is now deprecated. Use the `Select` component instead.
- `SelectDefautWithOptions` is now deprecated. Use the `SelectDefault` component
  with `children` instead.
- `Table.Header` is now deprecated. Use `Table.THead` instead.
- `Table.Body` is now deprecated. Use `Table.TBody` instead.
