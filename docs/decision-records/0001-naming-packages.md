# Renaming the look and feel packages

## Status

Rejected.

## Context

There is a risk that in the future the name **look and feel** might be obsolete,
being replaced with "Apollo". That change is not certain and not going to happen
in the near future (as of the 10th of november 2024). The package is not yet
released as stable on NPM, so it is not a big deal to change the name now. The
package will be renamed from `@axa-fr/design-system-look-and-feel-react` to
`@axa-fr/design-system-apollo-react` or `@axa-fr/design-system-client-react`.

## Decision

Given the incertainty of the future name of the package, we decide to keep the
current name `@axa-fr/design-system-look-and-feel-react`.

## Consequences

A name change might happen at some point in the future. Nothing changes for now
for our users.
