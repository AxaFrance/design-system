# MultiMessage

To use the multi-message import it like that:

```tsx
import { MultiMessage } from "@axa-fr/canopee-react/client";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const notifications = [
    { key: "Notification 1", value: "First important message" },
    { key: "Notification 2", value: "Second important message" },
    { key: "Notification 3", value: "Third important message" },
  ];

  return <MultiMessage notifications={notifications} />;
};
```

## Description

The `MultiMessage` component allows you to display multiple notifications with navigation controls. When there's only one notification, it displays as a simple message without navigation controls. When there are multiple notifications, users can navigate between them using previous/next buttons and see their current position.

## Heading

You can set the title level with `heading` prop : "h2" | "h3" | "h4" | "h5" | "h6", the default is "h2".

```tsx
<MultiMessage notifications={notifications} heading="h3" />
```

## Customization

You can customize the labels for accessibility:

```tsx
<MultiMessage
  notifications={notifications}
  previousLabel="Previous notification"
  nextLabel="Next notification"
  separatorText="of"
/>
```
