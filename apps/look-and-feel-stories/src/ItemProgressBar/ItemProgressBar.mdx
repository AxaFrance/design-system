# ItemProgressBar

The `ItemProgressBar` component displays a visual indicator of progress. It is based on the native HTML `<progress>` element and can be customized using standard props.

By default, the maximum value (`max` prop) is set to `1`, which means the `value` prop should be between 0 and 1 (for example, 0.7 for 70%).
You can override the `max` prop if you want to use a different scale (for example, `max=100` for percentage values).

## Usage

```tsx title="Example usage"
import { ItemProgressBar } from "@axa-fr/design-system-apollo-react/lf";

const MyComponent = () => <ItemProgressBar value={0.7} />;
```

## Playground

<Canvas of={ItemProgressBarStories.Playground} sourceState="shown" />

<Controls of={ItemProgressBarStories.Playground} />

## Accessibility: Indicating Current Progress

For accessibility, always use the `label` prop to provide a descriptive label for the progress bar. This ensures that assistive technologies can correctly announce the purpose and current state of the progress bar.

```tsx title="Accessible ItemProgressBar"
<ItemProgressBar value={0.7} label="Loading something..." />
```

This approach improves accessibility by associating a visible and programmatic label with the progress bar.
