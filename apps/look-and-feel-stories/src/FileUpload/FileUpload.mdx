# FileUpload

The `FileUpload` component provides a dropzone and an accessible file input control similar to `InputFile`, and adds a dedicated area to display uploaded files. The uploaded files area is rendered by providing one or more `ItemFile` components as `children`, which gives full flexibility for preview/remove links and per-file error messages.

Usage example:

```tsx
import { FileUpload, ItemFile } from "@axa-fr/design-system-apollo-react/lf";

const Example = () => (
  <FileUpload
    id="attachments"
    label="Attach supporting documents"
    description="Drop files here or use the button to select"
    helper="Up to 2 files — pdf, png, jpg — 5 MB max each"
    fileListLabel="Your uploaded files:"
  >
    <ItemFile
      file={
        new File([new Uint8Array(1024)], "example.jpg", { type: "image/jpg" })
      }
    />
    <ItemFile
      file={
        new File([new Uint8Array(1024)], "contract.pdf", {
          type: "application/pdf",
        })
      }
      errorMessage="This file is larger than 5MB"
    />
  </FileUpload>
);
```

### Props

Note: `FileUpload` inherits all props from the `InputFile` component. The table below lists the props specific to `FileUpload` or commonly used with it — consult the `InputFile` documentation for the full set of inherited props.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Prop</th>
      <th scope="col">Type</th>
      <th scope="col">Default</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>children</code>
      </td>
      <td>ReactNode</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>
        One or more `ItemFile` elements representing uploaded files. Using
        `children` allows flexible rendering of preview/remove links and
        per-file error messages inside each `ItemFile`.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>fileListLabel</code>
      </td>
      <td>ReactNode</td>
      <td>
        <code>"Vos fichiers importés :"</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Label displayed above the uploaded files list. If no `children` are
        provided, the list and label are not rendered.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> Note: Most native `<input>` props are supported and forwarded to the internal `<input type="file">` (except `type`, which is forced to `file`).
> The `className` and `style` props apply to the component container, not the native input element.
