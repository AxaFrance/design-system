import { Canvas, Controls, Meta } from "@storybook/addon-docs";
import * as ButtonStories from "./Button.stories";

<Meta of={ButtonStories} name="Button" />

# Button

To use the button import it like that:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@axa-fr/design-system-look-and-feel-react";

const MyComponent = () => <Button variant="secondary">My button</Button>;
```

## Playground

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Playground}></Canvas>

<Controls of={ButtonStories.Playground} />

## Variants

Use the `variant` prop to change the look of the button. [See the examples](#all-variants).

You can also add your own modifier, and the output will be a custom class called `af-btn-client--<yourModifier>` that you can target in your css
The rest of the props (eg: `type`, `title`) will be passed down to the actual `button` HTML element.

## All variants

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.All} layout="fullscreen" />

## With icons

To add an icon you need to add the prop, either `iconLeft` or `iconRight` whether you want the icon on the left of or on the right.
