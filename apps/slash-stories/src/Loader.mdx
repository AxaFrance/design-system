# Loader

The loader is a component to show a loading svg in your project.
Three variants are available:

- `default`: a oneline loader. This is the default variant.
- `fullScreen`: a fullscreen loader
- `content`: same as the fullScreen loader but with a smaller loader svg, to be used inside content areas.

```tsx
import { Loader } from "@axa-fr/design-system-slash-react";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Loader variant="default" text="Recherche en cours" />
);
```

NB : Previously, the loader was used to wrap the content shown after loading. This is not the case anymore, you just need to use the loader component and to show/hide it depending on your loading state.
The previous loader is still available to ease the migration, it has been tagged as deprecated and will be removed in next major release.

## Playground

<Canvas of={LoaderStories.Default} />
<Controls of={LoaderStories.Default} />
