# Accordion

Based on [`summary` and `details` _elements_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details), the accordion component is a simple way to hide and show related content on a page.

## Components

The Accordion is composed of the following components:

- `Accordion`: The main container for multiple collapsable sections.
- `CollapseItem`: A single collapsable section in the accordion.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Default} />
<Controls of={AccordionStories.Default} />

## Usage

### Only one expanded at a time

Setting the `onlyOne` prop on the accordion component will ensure that only one section is expanded at a time.
By default, this is not the case and multiple sections can be expanded at once.

### Opening sections by default

You can set the `open` prop on the `CollapseItem` component to have a section open by default.
Afterwards, the component becomes uncontrolled and only the user can close it via click or keyboard inputs.

### Light version

The `light` classModifier can be set on the `Accordion` component to use a lighter version of the accordion.

<Controls of={AccordionStories.Light} />
