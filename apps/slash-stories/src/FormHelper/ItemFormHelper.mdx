# ItemFormHelper

The `ItemFormHelper` component displays a single step in a form helper or stepper, with different visual states depending on its `mode` prop. It can optionally render as a link if the `ancre` prop is provided.

## Import

```javascript
import { ItemFormHelper } from "@axa-fr/design-system-slash-react";
```

## Usage without anchor

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />

## Usage with anchor

If the `ancre` prop is provided, the label is rendered as a link to the corresponding anchor in the page.


<Canvas of={Stories.Anchor} />

## Modes

The `mode` prop controls the visual state of the step:

- `locked`: The step is locked and not accessible. The label is shown as plain text and styled as blocked.
- `edited`: The step is currently being edited. The label is styled as active.
- `validated`: The step is completed and validated. The label is styled as validated.
- `disabled`: The step is disabled and not accessible.

## Example

```jsx
<ItemFormHelper label="Locked" mode="locked" />
<ItemFormHelper label="Edited" mode="edited" ancre="etape2" />
<ItemFormHelper label="Validated" mode="validated" ancre="etape3" />
<ItemFormHelper label="Disabled" mode="disabled" />
```

## Accessibility

- The anchor (`<a>`) includes an `aria-label` for better screen reader support.
- The component uses semantic HTML (`<li>`, `<a>`, `<span>`) for proper list and navigation structure.
