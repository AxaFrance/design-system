# Icons

## Icon Recommended

The design system recommends using icons from the [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) library as a priority. These icons are available via the [`@material-symbols/svg-400`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-symbols/svg-400) package. They provide extensive functional coverage and a modern style aligned with current standards.

```bash
npm install @material-symbols/svg-400
```

### Example of Using Material Icons

```tsx
import home from "@material-symbols/svg-400/outlined/home.svg";
import { Svg } from "@axa-fr/design-system-slash-react";

export const Example = () => <Svg src={home} />;
```

## Glyphicons (Deprecated)

Historically, the design system used Glyphicons. These icons are still available for backward compatibility but are now considered **deprecated**. It is strongly recommended to migrate to Material icons for new developments.

### Example of Using Glyphicons (Deprecated)

```tsx
import "@axa-fr/design-system-slash-css/dist/common/icons.scss";

export const Example = () => <span className="glyphicon glyphicon-home" />;
```

<Canvas of={IconsStories.Glyphicon} />
<Controls of={IconsStories.Glyphicon} />

> **Note:** Glyphicons will no longer receive updates and may be removed in a future major release.

### All Glyphicons

<Canvas of={IconsStories.AllIcons} />
