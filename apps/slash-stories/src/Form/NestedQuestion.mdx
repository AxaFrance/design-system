# NestedQuestion

The `NestedQuestion` component is a form component that allows the user to add some nested input block under an input.

For example, if the reply of a question inside your form should show another set of questions, you should use the `NestedQuestion` component.

To use the NestedQuestion import it like that:

```tsx
import { NestedQuestion } from "@axa-fr/design-system-slash-react";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <NestedQuestion>
    <p>Whatever you want here</p>
  </NestedQuestion>
);
```

<Controls of={NestedQuestionStories.Playground} />
