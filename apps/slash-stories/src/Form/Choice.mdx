# Choice components

## Choice

This is the a multi-options component. You can use it to create a list of options without the main label.

<Canvas of={ChoiceStories.ChoiceStory} />
<Controls of={ChoiceStories.ChoiceStory} />

## ChoiceInput

This is the complete input component. It contains the main label and the list of options.

<Canvas of={ChoiceInputStories.ChoiceInputStory} />
<Controls of={ChoiceInputStories.ChoiceInputStory} />

## Modes

The Choice component uses the Radio component which has 3 modes: `default`, `classic` and `inline`.
You can see them in action in the stories above.

## Required

The component can be required. In that case, the label will be followed by a red asterisk. In order to make the component required, set the `required` prop to `true`.

Alternatively you can to add to the `classModifier` the value `required`. This behaviour exists to keep backward compatibility but might disapear in the future.
