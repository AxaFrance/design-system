# ItemProgressBar

The `ItemProgressBar` component displays a visual indicator of progress. It is based on the native HTML `<progress>` element and can be customized using standard props.

By default, the maximum value (`max` prop) is set to `100`, allowing you to manage the `value` prop as a percentage.

## Usage

```tsx title="Example usage"
import { ItemProgressBar } from "@axa-fr/design-system-apollo-react";

const MyComponent = () => <ItemProgressBar value={70} />;
```

## Playground

<Canvas of={ItemProgressBarStories.Playground} sourceState="shown" />

<Controls of={ItemProgressBarStories.Playground} />

## Accessibility: Indicating Current Progress

To indicate that the progress bar represents the current step or element, you can use the `aria-current` prop:

```tsx title="Current ItemProgressBar"
<ItemProgressBar value={70} aria-current="step">
  Step 2 in progress
</ItemProgressBar>
```

This improves accessibility by signaling to assistive technologies that this progress bar is the current item.
